**Monster Defense**
A Python based tower defense game made with pygame! Monster Defense uses real-time enemy AI, procedural wave scaling, fully modular tower system, upgrade mechanics, 
and in-game economy all implemented using an object oriented programming approach. Using the gold obtained via economy buildings and killing enemies, you must build towers to fight back 
against waves of endlessly scaling enemies. See how far you can make it in this challenging tower defense game! 

Features:
* Real-time game loop with state management (start, pause, end screens)

* Multiple enemy types with distinct stats and behavior:
* Ghoul, Golem, Wizard
* Fully modular towers:
* Archer Tower (single-target projectiles)
* Bomb Tower (area-of-effect damage)
* Tesla Tower (chain lightning & slows)
